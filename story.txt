	Henry is a student at UW-Madiosn. He learns computer-science.  
	It was a Wednsday afternoon when Henry is preparing for his 
computer-science midterm. He found out that he knew little about git and 
version control, which was going to be on the exam. He decided to do some 
review on it, and the best way to learn version control is to actually 
practice it.
