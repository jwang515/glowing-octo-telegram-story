	Henry is a student at UW-Madiosn. He learns computer-science.  
	It was a Wednsday afternoon when Henry is preparing for his 
computer-science midterm. He found out that he knew little about git and 
version control, which was going to be on the exam. He decided to do some 
review on it, and the best way to learn version control is to actually 
practice it.

	He pushed and pushed and pulled and pulled. Github commands he
finally knew like the back of his hand. Finally exam day came and a 
spooky unknown git command showed up on the exam!
    What a pity for that boy! By the way, he becomes a git master who
knows every git command after that bad day!
	But he failed the exam and was kicked out of the school. What a 
poor boy!
